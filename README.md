# LaunchNRoll
A script to translate MIDI between control surfaces and devices (like synths).

Initially developed for and tested with the Novation LaunchControl XL and the Yamaha PLG150-AN.

The main perk is that it can translate MIDI CC to Sysex.

The communication is bi-directional, so the lights on control surface can be controlled.
